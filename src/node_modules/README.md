# Questions Loader
## Purpose
To asynchronously load questions data into external modules

### API
**getQuestions(number, difficulty, callback)**
   * **number** - the number of questions desired (must be a positive integer)
   * **difficulty** - the difficulty of the questions desired (1 = easy, 2 = medium, 3 = hard)
   * **callback**
      * a function that executes once the questions data has been gathered
      * The callback function must have one parameter, which will be the incoming questions data
      * Any transformations, processing, etc. performed on theq questions data must be performed in this callback
